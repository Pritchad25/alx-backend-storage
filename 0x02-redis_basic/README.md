## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Basic Redis feat features.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Learn how to use redis for basic operations
- Learn how to use redis as a simple cache

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All of your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
- All your functions and methods should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
