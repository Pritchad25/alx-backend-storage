## About <a name="about"></a>
This repository contains projects of the ALX Backend Storage Track/Sprint, under the ALX Software Engineering Curriculum.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
 All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the repo and each folder of each project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
